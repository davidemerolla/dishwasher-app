# Dishwasher App - Build Instructions

Since you are on Windows, you cannot build the iOS app directly. However, I have generated the source code for you.

## Option 1: If you have access to a Mac
1. Open **Xcode**.
2. Create a new **iOS App** project named "DishwasherApp".
3. Select **SwiftUI** as the Interface.
4. Copy the files from `Documents/DishwasherApp/Source` into your Xcode project:
   - `ShiftManager.swift`
   - `ContentView.swift`
   - `DishwasherApp.swift` (Replace the default one)
   - `NotificationManager.swift`
5. Build and run on your iPhone.

## Option 2: Web App (Recommended for Windows)
If you don't have a Mac, I can create a **Web App** version that you can host for free (e.g., on Vercel or GitHub Pages) and add to your iPhone home screen.
This will work exactly like an app.

**Let me know if you want me to generate the Web App version instead!**
